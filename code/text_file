Project: Sentiment Classification and Model Selection
Objective:
Preprocess a dataset containing user feedback, train multiple classification models, and determine the best-suited model for predicting feedback sentiment (positive or negative).

Steps to Complete the Project
1. Data Understanding
Review the dataset structure and familiarize yourself with the columns:
Text: Feedback content (critical feature).
Sentiment: Target variable (positive/negative).
Additional features (e.g., Source, Location, Confidence Score) may be explored for added value.
Identify key metrics for success (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).
2. Data Preprocessing
a. Handle Missing Data:

Identify missing values in all columns.
Drop rows with missing or null Text.
Decide how to handle missing values in secondary features (e.g., impute Confidence Score or drop columns with too many missing values).
b. Remove Duplicates:

Remove duplicate rows, especially based on the Text column.
c. Clean the Text Column:

Normalize text by converting to lowercase.
Remove stopwords (e.g., "the," "is," "and").
Tokenize text (split sentences into individual words).
Remove special characters, punctuation, numbers, and URLs.
Apply stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.
d. Feature Engineering:

Extract numerical features from the cleaned text using:
Bag of Words (BoW).
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze the distribution of positive vs. negative sentiments.
Visualize word frequencies for each sentiment class using bar charts or word clouds.
Assess relationships between features (e.g., does Source influence sentiment?).
Highlight any imbalances in the dataset (e.g., more positive feedback than negative).
4. Model Training and Evaluation
a. Split the Dataset:

Divide the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
b. Train Multiple Models:

Train the following classification models:
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).
For each model, use both BoW and TF-IDF features to determine which approach performs better.
c. Hyperparameter Tuning:

Perform hyperparameter optimization using techniques like:
Grid Search.
Random Search.
Tune parameters such as learning rate, maximum depth, and number of estimators for tree-based models, or C and kernel type for SVM.
d. Evaluate Models:

Assess each model's performance on the test data using the following metrics:
Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.
Precision: Accuracy of positive predictions.
Recall: Ability to find all positive instances.
F1-Score: Balance between precision and recall.
ROC-AUC: Evaluate model discrimination ability.
e. Select the Best Model:

Compare the models based on evaluation metrics.
Identify the model that provides the best balance of precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Finalize the Best Model
Save the best-performing model using serialization (e.g., pickle or joblib).
Test the model on unseen data to validate its performance.
6. Documentation
Provide a comprehensive report covering:
Data preprocessing steps.
EDA findings with visualizations.
Performance metrics for each model.
Justification for selecting the best model.
